# JR / Spektrum / Futaba BuddyBox PPM Audio Driver

by Nicholas Robinson

## Overview

This driver allows a JR (Japan Remote Control Co., Ltd.), Spektrum (Horizon Hobby, Inc.) or Futaba (Hobbico, Inc.) radio transmitter to communicate with a PC (Windows / OS X / Linux) and vice versa. It is written in ANSI C, leveraging the excellent PortAudio (Portable Cross-Platform Audio) I/O library, and facilitates one-way communication from the radio transmitter to the PC (or from PC to radio transmitter) via any available audio input/output device (headphone, microphone, line-in etc) and the transmitter's trainer port. It is capable of receiving PPM signals generated by a radio transmitter and simultaneously generating and sending its own PPM signals without a USB dongle.

The applications of this driver are threefold:
* Receive and decode PPM signals from a radio transmitter
* Encode and transmit PPM signals to a radio transmitter
* Receive and decode PPM signals from a radio transmitter, augment and re-transmit PPM signals to another radio transmitter

The first two applications are self explanatory (and likely the most useful), providing the possibility to use a radio transmitter as an input device on a PC (potentially for controlling a flight simulator) and conversely using other input mechanisms (GUI, gamepad, mouse, keyboard) to control a remote-control vehicle via a radio transmitter. The third application accommodates more creative applications - for example this driver could form part of a data logger between a student and teacher, logging all student commands for later analysis, whilst still permitting buddy box flight instruction. It could also allow for hybrid manual/computer control of a remote control vehicle, where primary control inputs are augmented by a computer program before being sent to the remote control vehicle.

## Notes

* You may need to change the default input device via your operating system's control panel to suit your audio input device.
* You may need to tune "DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE" via command-line to suit your audio input device (defaults to 124kHz if not specified). A higher sample rate will yield a higher resolution on each channel's output. For example 44.1kHz sample rate -> resolution of ~36 per channel, whereas 192kHz sample rate -> resolution of ~154 per channel.
* Depending on your sound card's characteristics, you may need to tweak "BAD_PACKET_THRESHOLD" and "SAMPLE_NOISE_THRESHOLD" in "BuddyBox.h"

Please let me know if you find this useful or come up with any novel implementations.

Enjoy!
